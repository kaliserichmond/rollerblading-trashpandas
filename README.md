# Test Repo for team

## How to use
- create a branch with your name (for now until we figure out dev best practices)
- go through the dev-learning resources for each topic, add additional resources you find helpful
- use the cloud1 or cloud2 folder to build out test flows and exercises 
- add notes, questions or anything that is useful 
- commit your code and push your branch at the end of the day. it doesnt have to be perfect. we can share examples and clean up the code later. 
- cloud 1 and cloud 2 invites from Kalise
- use any technology you want to build and learn :D
